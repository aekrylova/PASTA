\title{Find polyA sites that are differentially used across cells, utilizing
polyA residuals.}
\usage{
FindDifferentialPolyA(
  object,
  assay = "polyA",
  ident.1,
  ident.2,
  features = NULL,
  covariates = NULL,
  gene.names = "Gene_Symbol"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object}

\item{assay}{name of polyAsite assay to test. Default is polyA.}

\item{ident.1}{Identity class to find polyA sites for}

\item{ident.2}{A second identity class for comparison.}

\item{features}{Features to test. Default is all features. If a subset of
features is provided, pct.1 and pct.2 will be calculated using all features
with the same gene annotation where residuals have been calculated.}

\item{covariates}{Vector of covariates to include in linear model.}

\item{gene.names}{Column name providing gene annotation of each polyA site.
Default is "Gene_Symbol"}
